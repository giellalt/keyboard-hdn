This document contains a suggestion for two different
Northern Haida keyboards, one for fast typing and one
for occasional typing.

## Haida keyboard layout with Haida letters on level 1, 2

|   1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 0
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
|   ĝ  |  w  |  e  |  g̲  |  t  |  y  |  u  |  i  |  o  |  p  
|   a  |  s  |  d  |  k̲  |  g  |  h  |  j  |  k  |  l  |  -      
|   x̂  |  x  |  c  |  x̲  |  b  |  n  |  m  |  -  |  -  |  -      

The replaced letters *q, r, f, z, v* are accessed by 
holding down the alt key and pressing the respective key.

Test versions of this keyboard fro Macintosh may be downloaded, cf.
[Haida kayboard](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/keyboards/layouts/hdn/).

The two files in the hdn folder must be copied to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
Thereafter go to Control Panel > Keylayout > Meyboard input method.

Press the '+' button, and Haida should be under the entry "Other".

Issues: The accented vowels are under alt e (acute) and alt u (umlaut).
TODO: Add them as follows:

* ä shift C11 + vowel
* á etc.  C11 + vowel

## Haida keyboard layout with Haida letters on level 3, 4

* k̲ = alt k
* g̲ = alt g
* x̲ = alt x
* x̂ = alt r
* ĝ = alt q

This keyboard will function for occasional typing of Haida text. 
It has not been implemented yet.
